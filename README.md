# AI Customer Support Agent — Amazon

An AI customer-support agent built using the **Customer Support on Twitter (TWCS)** dataset.

The system is designed around three tasks:

1. **Intent classification** — classify an incoming customer message into a small Amazon-specific intent taxonomy.
2. **Reply drafting** — retrieve historically similar Amazon support replies and use them as grounding for a response.
3. **Routing** — decide whether the message should be `auto_handle` or `escalate`, with a stated reason.

The project also includes baselines, a golden evaluation set, error analysis, and an LLM-as-judge workflow.

> **Important:** Generated evaluation artifacts and the raw dataset are not necessarily committed to GitHub. The commands below explain how to reproduce them locally.

# 2. Environment

Recommended:

* Python 3.10+
* Windows, macOS or Linux
* Internet connection for installing packages and downloading models

Create a virtual environment.

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### macOS/Linux

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

# 3. Dataset

This project uses the **Customer Support on Twitter (TWCS)** dataset.

Dataset:

```text
thoughtvector/customer-support-on-twitter
```

The raw dataset is intentionally not committed to GitHub because of its size.

Place the dataset CSV in the project according to the expectations of the project scripts.

If `twcs.csv` already exists in the project directory, it can be used directly.

---

# 4. Running the Pipeline

Run the following steps in order.

## Step 1 — Audit brands

```bash
python audit_brands.py
```

This inspects the brands present in the dataset and allows Amazon to be selected.

---

## Step 2 — Build Amazon dataset

```bash
python build_amazon_dataset.py
```

This extracts the Amazon-related support conversations.

---

## Step 3 — Derive the taxonomy

```bash
python derive_taxonomy.py
```

The current Amazon taxonomy contains:

```text
delivery_issue
damaged_item_or_product_issue
prime_membership_issue
support_process_complaint
other
```

The taxonomy was derived from the Amazon support data rather than importing a generic customer-support taxonomy.

---

## Step 4 — Build retrieval index

```bash
python build_retrieval_index.py
```

This creates the semantic retrieval artifacts used to find historically similar Amazon support interactions.

---

## Step 5 — Create the golden evaluation set

```bash
python make_golden_set.py
```

The current evaluation uses:

```text
200 examples
```

This satisfies the assignment requirement of 150–250 hand-labelled examples.

---

## Step 6 — Run the agent

```bash
python agent_pipeline.py
```

The agent performs:

```text
Customer message
       ↓
Intent classification
       ↓
Historical reply retrieval
       ↓
Draft reply
       ↓
AUTO-HANDLE / ESCALATE
```

The generated output is written to:

```text
results/agent_outputs.jsonl
```

Each output contains information such as:

```text
customer_text
predicted_intent
intent_confidence
all_similarities
route
route_reason
drafted_reply
grounding
```

---

# 5. Intent Evaluation

Run:

```bash
python evaluate_agent.py
```

This reports:

* Precision
* Recall
* F1
* Intent accuracy
* Prediction mismatches

Current evaluation:

```text
Golden set size: 200
Intent accuracy: 0.51
```

Per-class results currently include:

| Intent                        | Precision | Recall |   F1 |
| ----------------------------- | --------: | -----: | ---: |
| delivery_issue                |      0.60 |   0.50 | 0.55 |
| damaged_item_or_product_issue |      0.17 |   0.32 | 0.22 |
| prime_membership_issue        |      0.70 |   0.74 | 0.72 |
| support_process_complaint     |      0.53 |   0.58 | 0.56 |
| other                         |      0.33 |   0.14 | 0.20 |

---

# 6. Baselines

Run:

```bash
python baselines.py
```

The project compares the agent against two baselines.

### Baseline 1 — Majority Classifier

Always predicts the most common intent.

### Baseline 2 — TF-IDF + Logistic Regression

A conventional text classification baseline using TF-IDF features and Logistic Regression with 5-fold cross-validation.

### Current results

| System                       | Accuracy | Macro-F1 |
| ---------------------------- | -------: | -------: |
| Majority baseline            |     0.30 |     0.09 |
| TF-IDF + Logistic Regression |     0.30 |     0.18 |
| Agent                        |     0.51 |     0.45 |

The agent therefore currently outperforms both baselines on the recorded golden-set evaluation.

---

# 7. LLM Reply Evaluation

The project includes an LLM-as-judge component in:

```text
llm_judge.py
```

The judge evaluates drafted replies on:

1. Relevance
2. Helpfulness
3. Groundedness
4. Brand consistency
5. Hallucination avoidance
6. Overall quality

The judge should evaluate whether the response actually addresses the customer rather than rewarding generic polite language.

## OpenRouter

The LLM judge can use an OpenRouter model.

Example PowerShell configuration:

```powershell
$env:OPENROUTER_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
$env:OPENROUTER_MODEL="nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b:free"
```

Then run:

```powershell
python llm_judge.py
```

Results are saved to:

```text
results/judge_results.json
```

### Security

Never commit the API key to GitHub.

Do not place the key directly inside Python source code.

If an API key is accidentally exposed, revoke it and create a new one.

---

# 8. Human Evaluation

Human evaluation must use **genuine human ratings**.

AI-generated ratings must not be presented as human evaluation.

The review uses a 1–5 scale:

| Score | Meaning                        |
| ----- | ------------------------------ |
| 1     | Completely wrong or unrelated  |
| 2     | Mostly wrong                   |
| 3     | Partially useful               |
| 4     | Good                           |
| 5     | Excellent and directly helpful |

The reviewer should judge the actual drafted reply against the customer's message.

After completing the human review, run:

```bash
python human_agreement.py
```

This is used to compare human ratings with the LLM judge.

---

# 9. Error Analysis

Run:

```bash
python analyze_errors.py
```

The error analysis examines real examples of incorrect or poor behavior.

Important observed failure patterns include:

### 1. Unrelated replies

Some delivery complaints receive replies that discuss unrelated account or packaging issues.

### 2. Low-confidence escalation

Some legitimate product or service questions are escalated simply because the classifier is uncertain.

### 3. Difficult `other` category

Many messages do not fit cleanly into the small four-domain taxonomy and therefore create confusion around `other`.

### 4. Keyword/rule interference

Simple keyword rules can cause the system to select an incorrect intent when a keyword appears in an unrelated context.

### 5. Generic support responses

A response may sound professional but still fail to answer the customer's actual question.

These examples are important because the headline accuracy number alone does not reveal these failure modes.

---

# 10. Routing

The agent makes one of two routing decisions:

```text
AUTO-HANDLE
```

or:

```text
ESCALATE
```

The system currently considers factors such as:

* legal threats
* refund/chargeback requests
* account security concerns
* urgent/time-bound situations
* low intent confidence

The output contains a routing reason:

```text
route
route_reason
```

The routing decision is intentionally conservative for higher-risk situations.

---

# 11. What the System Does NOT Build

This project is an evaluation prototype.

It does not:

* access real Amazon customer accounts
* modify orders
* issue real refunds
* access payment information
* guarantee delivery dates
* contact customers
* replace human support agents
* provide a general-purpose support taxonomy
* assume historical replies are always correct
* claim that retrieval alone guarantees a correct answer

---

# 12. Reproducibility

A basic local reproduction is:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

python audit_brands.py
python build_amazon_dataset.py
python derive_taxonomy.py
python build_retrieval_index.py
python make_golden_set.py
python agent_pipeline.py
python evaluate_agent.py
python baselines.py
python analyze_errors.py
```

For LLM reply evaluation:

```bash
python llm_judge.py
```

For human/judge agreement:

```bash
python human_agreement.py
```

The first execution may take longer because the sentence-transformer model needs to be downloaded.

---

# 13. Generated Results

The following files are generated during the workflow:

```text
results/
├── agent_outputs.jsonl
├── brand_audit.json
├── decision_log.md
├── draft_taxonomy.json
├── golden_set_ai_labels.jsonl
├── golden_set_labeled.jsonl
├── golden_set_prelabel.jsonl
├── golden_set_unlabeled.jsonl
├── judge_results.json
├── my_labels.json
└── review_sheet.csv
```

These files contain evaluation artifacts and generated outputs.

Large datasets and model/index artifacts should generally remain outside GitHub.

---

# 14. Current Headline Result

On the current 200-example golden evaluation:

```text
Intent accuracy = 0.51
Macro-F1 = 0.45
```

The agent outperforms the two implemented baselines:

```text
Majority:
Accuracy = 0.30
Macro-F1 = 0.09

TF-IDF + Logistic Regression:
Accuracy = 0.30
Macro-F1 = 0.18

Agent:
Accuracy = 0.51
Macro-F1 = 0.45
```

However, **0.51 accuracy should not be interpreted as “51% of customer support conversations are solved correctly.”**

Intent classification is only one part of the system. Reply relevance, grounding, hallucination risk, and escalation quality must also be considered.

---

# 15. Limitations

The current evaluation has several limitations:

* The golden set contains 200 examples.
* Human evaluation requires genuine human annotation.
* The taxonomy contains a difficult `other` class.
* Some thresholds were tuned during development.
* Intent classification and escalation are separate problems.
* Historical Twitter support conversations can be noisy or incomplete.
* A retrieved historical reply can still be inappropriate for a new customer.
* The current headline accuracy does not measure whether the customer actually received a successful resolution.
* Routing quality needs its own evaluation rather than being inferred from intent accuracy.

These limitations should be considered when interpreting the results.

# 17. Future Work

With another week of development, the highest-value improvements would be:

1. Improve the taxonomy using additional human review.
2. Add a dedicated escalation gold set.
3. Improve retrieval so the selected historical reply is more closely matched to the customer's issue.
4. Add stronger safeguards against unrelated replies.
5. Use a second human annotator and measure inter-annotator agreement.
6. Evaluate reply quality independently from intent classification.
7. Test the system on a larger held-out dataset.
8. Separate development/tuning data from the final test set.

The most important next goal is not simply increasing the headline accuracy, but improving **end-to-end support quality and safe routing**.
